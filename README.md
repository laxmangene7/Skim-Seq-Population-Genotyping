# Skim-Seq-Population-Genotyping
Genotyping a larger plant population using skim-sequencing such as Nextera sequencing has gained popularity as a low-cost, efficient and high accuracy sequencing method. However, no proper analysis method to generate genotyping file from the raw sequence files have been documented in public domain.  This protocol describe how we call variants from skim-seq population which is based on the deep-sequencing of the parental lines of the skim-seq population.
