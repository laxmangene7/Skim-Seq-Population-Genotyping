# Skim-Seq-Population-Genotyping
Genotyping a larger plant population using skim-sequencing such as Nextera sequencing has gained popularity as a low-cost, efficient and high accuracy sequencing method. However, no proper analysis method to generate genotyping file from the raw sequence files have been documented in public domain.  This protocol describe how we call variants from skim-seq population when we have deep-sequencing data of the parental lines and the skim-sequencing data of the progenies or mapping population.
